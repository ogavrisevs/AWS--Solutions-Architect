EC2 instance lifecycle
-----------------------

![instance lifecycle](./pic/instance-lifecycle.png)

1) When you launch an instance, it enters the pending state. When an instance is pending, billing has not started. At this stage, the instance is preparing to enter the running state. Pending is where AWS performs all actions needed to set up an instance, such as copying the AMI content to the root device and allocating the necessary networking components.

2) When your instance is running, it's ready to use. This is also the stage where billing begins. As soon as an instance is running, you can take other actions on the instance, such as reboot, terminate, stop, and stop-hibernate.

3) When you reboot an instance, itâ€™s different than performing a stop action and then a start action. Rebooting an instance is equivalent to rebooting an operating system. The instance remains on the same host computer, and maintains its public and private IP address, in addition to any data on its instance store.

4) It typically takes a few minutes for the reboot to complete. When you stop and start an instance, your instance may be placed on a new underlying physical server. Therefore, you lose any data on the instance store that were on the previous host computer. When you stop an instance, the instance gets a new public IP address but maintains the same private IP address. 

5) When you terminate an instance, the instance stores are erased, and you lose both the public IP address and private IP address of the machine. Termination of an instance means that you can no longer access the machine.
